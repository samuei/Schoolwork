The course is a survey of programming languages: their attributes, uses, advantages and disadvantages. 
Topics include scopes, parameter passing, storage management, control flow, exception handling, 
encapsulation and modularization mechanisms, reusability through genericity and inheritance, and type 
systems. In particular, several different languages will be studied which exemplify different language 
philosophies (e.g., procedural, functional, object-oriented, logic, scripting).
