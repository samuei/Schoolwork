Schoolwork
==========

A partial collection of assignments from my classes at the University of Kansas.

I may have lost some assignments and almost certainly most of the assignment specifications from older classwork. Apologies for any confusion. Assignments making use of proprietary code from professors or textbook publishers will not be added, which will also create gaps.
